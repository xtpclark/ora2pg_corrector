= Ora2Pg AI Corrector
:toc:
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

A smart web interface to accelerate Oracle to PostgreSQL migrations by automating the correction and validation of translated SQL code.

== Overview

Migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL often involves using tools like `ora2pg` to perform the initial code translation. While `ora2pg` provides an excellent starting point, the generated SQL frequently requires manual corrections and extensive testing to ensure compatibility and correctness in a live PostgreSQL environment.

The Ora2Pg AI Corrector is designed to streamline this crucial "last mile" of the migration process. It provides a web-based, multi-client workspace where developers can use a powerful AI engine to automatically correct translated SQL and then validate it against a live PostgreSQL database using a unique "self-healing" engine.

== Key Features

* **Web-based, Multi-Client Workspace:** Manage multiple migration projects or clients, each with its own set of configurations for AI providers, database connections, and `ora2pg` settings.
* **AI-Powered SQL Correction:** A dual-editor view allows you to paste Oracle SQL and get an AI-generated PostgreSQL equivalent that corrects for common syntax and function differences (e.g., `NVL` to `COALESCE`, `VARCHAR2` to `VARCHAR`).
* **Intelligent Validation Engine:** This is the core of the application, designed to test the corrected SQL against a real database and automatically resolve schema dependencies.
** Proactive Schema Generation:** For `SELECT` queries, the engine first parses the SQL to identify all required tables. It then makes a single, consolidated call to the AI to generate the DDL for all missing tables at once, drastically speeding up the setup process.
** Reactive Self-Healing:** If an error occurs, the engine attempts to fix it automatically:
*** On-the-fly DDL:** Catches `relation "..." does not exist` errors (e.g., from `FOREIGN KEY` references) and asks the AI to generate the DDL for the specific missing object before retrying.
*** AI Query Correction:** Catches other errors (e.g., syntax errors, missing columns) and asks the AI to fix the query itself before retrying.
* **Fine-Grained User Control:** Two checkboxes, `Clean Slate` and `Auto-create Tables`, give the user complete control over the validation environment, enabling workflows for initial discovery, iterative development, and validation against pre-existing "golden" schemas.

== How It Works: The Typical Workflow

. **Load Oracle SQL:** A user selects their client/project and pastes the Oracle SQL generated by `ora2pg` (or written by hand) into the left-side editor.
. **Correct with AI:** The user clicks "Correct with AI". The application sends the Oracle code to the configured AI model and displays the translated PostgreSQL code in the right-side editor.
. **Review & Refine:** The user can review the AI's translation and make manual edits if necessary.
. **Validate:** The user configures the `Clean Slate` and `Auto-create Tables` options and clicks "Validate". The application attempts to execute the PostgreSQL code against the validation database, using the self-healing engine to resolve any schema or syntax issues.
. **Save:** Once validated, the user can save the final, corrected, and verified PostgreSQL code.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose

=== Installation & Running

. Clone the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ora2pg-ai-corrector
----
. Create a `.env` file by copying the example. This file will store your application secrets and database configurations.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
----
. Edit the `.env` file with your specific settings:
+
[source,text]
----
# For the application's internal database (SQLite or Postgres)
# DB_BACKEND=sqlite
# PG_DSN_CONFIG=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/app_db

# For the PostgreSQL database used for validation
VALIDATION_PG_DSN=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/validation_db

# Application secrets
APP_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_fernet_encryption_key
----
. Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up --build
----
. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`.

== Configuration

* **AI Providers (`ai_config/ai_providers.json`):** Add or modify AI provider details in this file. The application will load these into its database on startup.
* **Ora2Pg Options (`ora2pg_config/default.cfg`):** The contents of this file are used to populate the available Ora2Pg configuration options in the UI's settings page.

== One-Click DDL Migration

The application now supports automated end-to-end DDL migration with a single click. This feature discovers Oracle schema objects, exports them via Ora2Pg, validates against PostgreSQL, and uses AI only when needed for error correction.

=== How It Works

[source,text]
----
Oracle Schema → Discovery → Ora2Pg Export → Validate → [AI Fix if needed] → Done
                  │              │              │              │
                  ▼              ▼              ▼              ▼
            SQL*Plus      TABLE, VIEW,    Execute on      Self-healing
            ALL_OBJECTS   PROCEDURE...    PostgreSQL      retry loop
----

**Key Optimization:** AI tokens are only spent when validation fails. If Ora2Pg output validates successfully (which is common), no AI calls are made.

=== Using the GUI

. Select your client from the dropdown
. Click the **"Start One-Click Migration"** button in the Migration pane
. Configure options:
** **Auto-create DDL:** Automatically create missing dependency tables (recommended)
** **Clean Slate:** Drop existing tables before validation (use for fresh starts)
. Click **"Start Migration"**
. Monitor progress via the progress bar and phase indicator
. Review results showing successful/failed files

=== Using the API (curl)

==== Step 1: Create and Configure a Client

[source,bash]
----
# Create a new client
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_name": "My_Migration_Project"}'

# Configure Oracle connection, validation database, and AI provider
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/client/1/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "oracle_dsn": "dbi:Oracle:host=oracle-server;service_name=ORCL;port=1521",
    "oracle_user": "schema_owner",
    "oracle_pwd": "password",
    "schema": "MY_SCHEMA",
    "pg_version": "16",
    "validation_pg_dsn": "dbname=staging user=postgres password=pass host=localhost port=5432",
    "ai_provider": "Anthropic Claude",
    "ai_endpoint": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/",
    "ai_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "ai_api_key": "sk-ant-..."
  }'
----

==== Step 2: Start the Migration

[source,bash]
----
# Start async migration (recommended for large schemas)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/client/1/start_migration \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"auto_create_ddl": true, "clean_slate": false}'

# Response:
# {"message":"Migration started","poll_url":"/api/client/1/migration_status","status":"running"}
----

==== Step 3: Poll for Status

[source,bash]
----
# Check progress (poll every few seconds)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/client/1/migration_status

# Response while running:
# {
#   "status": "running",
#   "phase": "validating",
#   "total_objects": 10,
#   "processed_objects": 5,
#   "successful": 4,
#   "failed": 0,
#   "errors": []
# }

# Response when complete:
# {
#   "status": "completed",
#   "successful": 10,
#   "failed": 0,
#   "files": [
#     {"file_id": 1, "filename": "output_table.sql", "status": "validated"},
#     {"file_id": 2, "filename": "output_view.sql", "status": "validated"},
#     ...
#   ]
# }
----

==== Alternative: Synchronous Migration

For smaller schemas, you can run the migration synchronously (blocks until complete):

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/client/1/run_migration_sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"auto_create_ddl": true}'
----

|`true`
|Automatically generate and apply DDL for missing dependency tables (e.g., foreign key references)
